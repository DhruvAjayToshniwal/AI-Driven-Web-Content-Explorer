A formal representation, of an object-oriented system, may be helpful to understand the behavior of software faults. Faults identification, at earlier stages, may help during the development and testing stages. In this paper, an attempt has been made to model several faults, in an object-oriented system, with the help of Colored Petri Nets. First, a formal representation of object-oriented properties is depicted by Colored Petri Nets. Secondly, various possible faults are modeled using different programming scenarios. The main emphasis was on faults that may arise due to objects and their interactions i.e. inheritance and polymorphism state. Such information may be useful during the testing and maintenance phases of software development.\n\u00c2\u00a9 Copyright 2023 Shubham Kaushik. Powered by\nJekyll\nwith\nal-folio\ntheme.
