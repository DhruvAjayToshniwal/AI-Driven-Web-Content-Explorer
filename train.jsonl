We also contributed to\nRotary International\n's diabetes data collection by testing 200+ individuals in Nashik. I also hosted the Alliance Cup (cricket), which was formed to encourage inter-Rotaract engagement. We were able to run various online and offline initiatives to encourage self-development, financial education, and self-care, in addition to helping to clean the roads of Nashik by partnering with 'NASHIK P..'\nIn my most recent contribution to the club, I discussed geopolitics and cryptocurrency with Soham A. on The NYF Podcast.", "source": "websites/dhruv-toshniwal_graduate-computerscience-boston-activity-6957947067616886784-d__o?trk=public_profile_like_view.html"}
